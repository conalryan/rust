## Install
Rustup: the Rust installer and version management tool
```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

## Toolchain Management `rustup`
- Rapid 6-week release cycle
- `rustup update`

## Configuring the PATH environment variable
- All tools are installed to the `~/.cargo/bin` directory (Rust toolchain: including rustc, cargo, and rustup).
- Include this directory in their `PATH` environment variable. 

## Test installation
`rustc --version`

## Cargo: the Rust build tool and package manager
When you install Rustup youâ€™ll also get the latest stable version of the Rust build tool and package manager, also known as Cargo. Cargo does lots of things:
- build your project with `cargo build`
- run your project with `cargo run`
- test your project with `cargo test`
- build documentation for your project with `cargo doc`
- publish a library to [crates.io](https://crates.io/) with `cargo publish`
- To test that you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can run this in your terminal of choice: `cargo --version`

## Code formatting tool Rustfmt
```bash
rustup component add rustfmt
```

## Linting tool Clippy
```bash
rustup component add clippy
```
